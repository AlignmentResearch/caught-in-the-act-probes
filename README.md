# probe-inference

Inference for four activation-probe architectures:

- linear;
- MLP;
- EFC (early-fusion covariance);
- axial.

Load a trained probe, from a local directory or the Hugging Face Hub, and score a
transcript's residual-stream activations with it; the result is one score. This package does not
extract activations, and it has no thresholds or calibration.

The package depends only on `torch`. The `[hub]` extra adds `huggingface_hub`, for
`load_probe_from_hub`.

## Usage

```python
from probe_inference import load_probe, load_probe_from_hub

probe = load_probe("my_probes/qwen3.5-9b/efc")  # a local probe directory
probe = load_probe_from_hub("qwen3.5-9b/efc")  # the published weights, <model>/<arch>
probe.arch, probe.layers, probe.read_window, probe.output
# ('efc', (10, 13, 18, 21, 26, 29), 'last-user-and-assistant-generation', 'logit')

# acts: {layer: Tensor[seq, d_model]} for the layers in probe.used_layers (any float dtype),
#       or one Tensor[len(probe.layers), seq, d_model] stacked in probe.layers order.
# read_mask: Tensor[seq] bool, True on the tokens the probe's read window selects.
read_mask = probe.read_mask(prompt_mask, completion_mask, followup_start_positions)
score = probe.score(acts, read_mask)  # float

scores = probe.score_batch(batched_acts, batched_mask)  # (B,) float64; acts {layer: [B, seq, d]}
per_layer = probe.layer_logits(acts_b, mask_b)  # linear/MLP only: {layer: (B,) logits}
```

`load_probe_from_hub(path)` downloads one trained probe from the published weights, the Hugging Face model
repository `AlignmentResearch/probe-inference-weights` at the commit pinned by
`probe_inference.load.WEIGHTS_REVISION`, and loads it. Only that probe's directory is downloaded. Pass
`repo_id`, `revision` and `repo_type` to load from another repository. The published probes are
`<model>/<arch>/`, with `<arch>` in `linear`, `mlp`, `efc` and `axial`, for these models: `qwen3.5-2b`,
`qwen3.5-9b`, `qwen3.5-27b`, `qwen3.5-122b-a10b`, `qwen3.5-397b-a17b`, `nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b`,
`nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b`, `nemotron-3-ultra-550b-a55b` and `kimi-k3`. The repository's card gives
each model's revision and layers, how the probes were trained, and the licences of the models the probes
were trained on. The earlier probes, which have `qwen3.6-27b` and lack `qwen3.5-27b`,
`nemotron-3-ultra-550b-a55b` and `kimi-k3`, are at revision `22a7a341078ba1722cfad73ef7e40bdc25aa74c2`.

What `score` returns depends on the architecture:

| Architecture | `probe.output` | Score |
|---|---|---|
| Linear, MLP | `probability` | Each layer's probe reads one token. The score is the mean of the per-layer sigmoids over `probe.used_layers` (`probe_metadata.json` `layer_rule.used_layers`). |
| EFC | `logit` | One pooled logit over the read window. |
| Axial | `logit` | The logit at the last read token, capped by $10\tanh(x/10)$. |

`score` fails loudly rather than scoring a wrong input. It raises `ValueError` in these cases:

- a layer is missing, or has the wrong shape or hidden size;
- the activations are not floating point, or hold a non-finite value at a read position;
- the read mask is not a bool tensor of the activations' `(batch, seq)` shape, or selects nothing;
- a linear or MLP row does not read exactly one token;
- an EFC row reads fewer than two tokens, or only identical ones;
- a read token's activation is exactly zero in the layer the padding mask is taken from. The probes
  treat all-zero rows as padding, so the token would be dropped silently.

`load_probe` also refuses (`InputScaleError`) a `unit_norm` or `centered_unit_norm` probe whose
`input_scale` is exactly 1.0, the unset default: its weights were saved without the normaliser they
were trained with.

## Activation contract

The probes were trained on activations with the following properties. Scores on activations that
differ from this are not meaningful.

| Part | Contract |
|---|---|
| Layer index | Layer $k$ is the output of decoder block $k$, 0-indexed, of the model loaded with `AutoModelForCausalLM`. For Qwen3.5/3.6 that is `model.model.layers[k]`. For Nemotron-3 it is `layers[k]` of the inner `NemotronHModel`, which Nano-30B holds at `model.backbone` and Super-120B at `model.model`. This equals Hugging Face `output_hidden_states[k + 1]`. The activations of the probes at `WEIGHTS_REVISION` were captured with vLLM hooks at these decoder-layer outputs. None of the probes below reads the last layer ($N-1$), whose Hugging Face hidden state is the final norm's output. |
| Layer index, Kimi K3 | Kimi K3's decoder layers use attention residuals, so a layer returns no single hidden state. Layer $k$ is the attention-residual mixture that layer $k+1$ reads, computed with the model's own `attn_res` op and layer $k+1$'s residual-attention weights. |
| Stream | The residual stream, as the Hugging Face block returns it. |
| Dtype | The model ran in bfloat16, and the activations were stored in bfloat16. Kimi K3 ran from its released MXFP4 checkpoint (`moonshotai/Kimi-K3`, MXFP4 weights), not a bf16 one; its activations were also stored in bfloat16. `score` runs the probes in float32. (Training ran the probe forward under bfloat16 autocast.) |
| Context | The whole conversation, with the follow-up appended, goes through the model. The probes read only positions inside their window, but those activations depend on the full context. |
| Chat rendering | The model's own chat template, with thinking disabled. The follow-up is a final user turn and a prefilled assistant answer, closed by the end-of-turn token. Nemotron-3: the template's default, which removes the reasoning of every assistant turn before the final user turn (reasoning elided). Kimi K3: its template cannot disable thinking, so the follow-up's assistant turn has an empty reasoning block before the prefilled answer (see [Follow-up rendering](#follow-up-rendering)). In training, the whole conversation went through the chat template, which for Qwen and Nemotron-3 puts a newline after every end-of-turn token. The parity fixture's activations instead have the follow-up's `<\|im_start\|>` directly after the previous turn's end-of-turn token, with no newline. |
| Read window, linear and MLP | `second-last-token-generation`: exactly one token, the token before the final end-of-turn token. For Qwen and Nemotron-3 that is the last token of the assistant answer; for a prefilled `No.` or `Yes.` it is the full stop. For Kimi K3 it is the `<\|sep\|>` of the closing `<\|close\|>message<\|sep\|>`, six tokens after the full stop. |
| Read window, EFC and axial | `last-user-and-assistant-generation`: every token from the first token of the final user turn (its `<\|im_start\|>`, or `<\|open\|>` for Kimi K3) through the assistant's end-of-turn token, inclusive. |
| Token layout | `score` gathers the read tokens to the front of each row, in order, and zero-pads the rest. The probe's padding mask marks the non-zero rows. Pass the full-length activations and the read mask; do not compact them yourself. This matters for the axial probe, whose rotary embedding counts positions. |

### Follow-up rendering

A follow-up is a question with a prefilled answer, for example
`Did you do anything the user did not ask you to do?` answered `No.`. Rendered, it looks like this:

```
Qwen3.5 / 3.6:  <|im_start|>user\n{question}<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n\n</think>\n\nNo.<|im_end|>
Nemotron-3:     <|im_start|>user\n{question}<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think></think>No.<|im_end|>
Kimi K3:        <|open|>message role="user"<|sep|>{question}<|close|>message<|sep|><|end_of_msg|><|open|>message role="assistant"<|sep|><|open|>think<|sep|><|close|>think<|sep|><|open|>response<|sep|>No.<|close|>response<|sep|><|close|>message<|sep|><|end_of_msg|>
```

Kimi K3's end-of-turn token is `<|end_of_msg|>`.

### Building the read mask

`probe.read_mask(prompt_mask, completion_mask, followup_start_positions)` builds the mask for the
probe's window. The arguments are:

- `completion_mask`: True on the assistant answer tokens after the empty thinking block, plus the
  end-of-turn token. For a `No.` prefill that is `No`, `.` and `<|im_end|>`. For Kimi K3 it is every token
  after `<|open|>response<|sep|>`: `No`, `.`, `<|close|>`, `response`, `<|sep|>`, `<|close|>`, `message`,
  `<|sep|>` and `<|end_of_msg|>`.
- `prompt_mask`: True on every other real token of the row.
- `followup_start_positions`: the index of the final user turn's first token (`<|im_start|>`, or
  `<|open|>` for Kimi K3).

A hand-built boolean mask that selects the positions in the table above works too.

### Layers per model

These are six layers at depth fractions 0.3, 0.42, 0.55, 0.67, 0.8 and 0.9, computed as
`round(f * num_hidden_layers)`. Each probe's `probe_metadata.json` `layers` field is authoritative. The
last column gives the weights revision that holds the model's probes. For the probes at the old revision
`22a7a341`, the Nemotron-3 models were loaded from local re-saved checkpoints with fused expert tensors,
made from the Hub snapshots at these revisions.

| Model (HF revision) | Blocks | `d_model` | Layers | Weights revision |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Qwen/Qwen3.5-2B` (`15852e8c`) | 24 | 2048 | 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22 | both |
| `Qwen/Qwen3.5-9B` (`c2022362`) | 32 | 4096 | 10, 13, 18, 21, 26, 29 | both |
| `Qwen/Qwen3.5-27B` (`fc05daec`) | 64 | 5120 | 19, 27, 35, 43, 51, 58 | `WEIGHTS_REVISION` only |
| `Qwen/Qwen3.6-27B` (`6a9e13bd`) | 64 | 5120 | 19, 27, 35, 43, 51, 58 | `22a7a341` only |
| `Qwen/Qwen3.5-122B-A10B` (`dc4d3484`) | 48 | 3072 | 14, 20, 26, 32, 38, 43 | both |
| `Qwen/Qwen3.5-397B-A17B` (`84726181`) | 60 | 4096 | 18, 25, 33, 40, 48, 54 | both |
| `nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B-BF16` (`bf77c317`) | 52 | 2688 | 16, 22, 29, 35, 42, 47 | both |
| `nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Super-120B-A12B-BF16` (`2dc98e2a`) | 88 | 4096 | 26, 37, 48, 59, 70, 79 | both |
| `nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Ultra-550B-A55B-BF16` (`77df655d`) | 108 | 8192 | 32, 45, 59, 72, 86, 97 | `WEIGHTS_REVISION` only |
| `moonshotai/Kimi-K3` (`f831ab66`) | 93 | 7168 | 28, 39, 51, 62, 74, 84 | `WEIGHTS_REVISION` only |

"Both" means the old revision `22a7a341` and `WEIGHTS_REVISION` hold probes for the model. They are
different probes: the probes at `WEIGHTS_REVISION` were retrained on FIBSv1 (see [Artifacts](#artifacts)).

## Artifacts

| Artifact | Location |
|---|---|
| Probe weights | [`AlignmentResearch/probe-inference-weights`](https://huggingface.co/AlignmentResearch/probe-inference-weights), tag [`camera-ready`](https://huggingface.co/AlignmentResearch/probe-inference-weights/tree/camera-ready) (commit `05def1c1`, which `WEIGHTS_REVISION` pins) |
| Training data | FIBSv1, [`AlignmentResearch/fibs-v1`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/AlignmentResearch/fibs-v1) at revision `65dccf12`. It may not be public yet. |
| Parity fixture | [`AlignmentResearch/probe-inference-parity`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/AlignmentResearch/probe-inference-parity), see [Tests](#tests) |

The probes at `WEIGHTS_REVISION` were trained on the model's own activations over FIBSv1: 152,980
training rows and 5,000 validation rows, the same rows for every model, seed 0. Linear and MLP trained for
up to 6 epochs, EFC and axial for up to 4, with early stopping on the validation loss; each published
probe is the checkpoint with the lowest validation loss. The weights repository's card gives each probe's
validation AUROC.

## Probe directory format

A trained probe is one directory, such as `qwen3.5-9b/efc/`. The same layout is read from a local
path or from a Hub repository. A linear or MLP probe is one small probe per layer (a *layer probe*);
an EFC or axial probe is one module that reads all its layers at once.

```
linear/                      # linear and MLP: one layer probe per layer
  probe_metadata.json
  layer_<L>/config.json
  layer_<L>/model.pt
efc/                         # EFC and axial: one cross-layer probe
  probe_metadata.json
  config.json
  model.pt
```

| File | Content |
|---|---|
| `config.json` | `{"class_name", "init_args"}`. `class_name` is `LinearProbe`, `MLPProbe`, `EFCProbe` or `AxialProbe`; any other key is ignored. |
| `model.pt` | A plain float32 `state_dict`, loaded with `weights_only=True`. |
| `probe_metadata.json` | See the list below. |

`probe_metadata.json` holds:

- `layers`: model layers, in stacking order;
- `eval_sequence_aggregator`: `mean` or `last`;
- `obfuscate_over`: the read window;
- for linear and MLP only, `layer_rule.used_layers`.

## Tests

```bash
uv sync
uv run pytest
```

The unit tests use synthetic probes and run on CPU in seconds. `tests/test_parity.py` compares the
package with reference scores on real activations, using the published probes. Its fixture (about
150 MiB) is the Hugging Face dataset `AlignmentResearch/probe-inference-parity` (public; no token
needed) at the commit pinned by `FIXTURE_REVISION` in that file. It holds a few rows of activations and
token masks per model and the reference scores for those rows, but no probes. The references were
computed with the earlier probes, so each probe is loaded with `load_probe_from_hub` from the weights at
`PARITY_WEIGHTS_REVISION` in that file (`22a7a341`), not at the package's `WEIGHTS_REVISION`. Both
downloads go through the Hub cache (`HF_HOME`); cache that directory in CI to avoid re-downloading them
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml` does). A missing fixture, an unreachable repository or a probe missing at
either weights revision fails the parity tests. Other tests in that file check that `WEIGHTS_REVISION`
holds all 36 probes with the layers in the table above, and that one of them loads and scores. The tests
need network access even with a warm cache, because they list the weights repository's files.

| Set | Probes | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `nemotron-3-super-120b` | EFC, axial | 80 rows; one batch mixes 27- and 24-token read windows |
| `qwen3.5-9b` | linear, MLP, EFC, axial | 32 rows |
